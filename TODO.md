# Software


Make it work

* Implement idle animation.
White breathing with red heartbeat.
Do it in C++ in case it needs to be moved to Arduino
Use randomization, maybe Brownian motion.
* Detect idle state
Use existinance of foreground object.
Start with binary yes/no
* Implement transition between idle and detected states
In detection state
* Improve color picking.
Should respect biggest/most prominent colors.
Can it be done just by sorting?

RPi

* Setup ssh config for single-command connection
* Check latency, no overlapping frames
* Set up autostart with systemd
* Test BackgoundSubtractor on RPi

# Checkpoints

* Monday, around 18.00. Connect remotely, set colors for picture.
Ideally test/enable the idle animation.
* Saturday, around 10.00. Deploy and test final installation code.

# Electronics

* Buy a new PSU cable
* Mount camera to structure
* Mount box to structure
